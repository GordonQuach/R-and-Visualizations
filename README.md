# Futbol Rosling Chart

I was inspired to create an animated chart in R when I came across Keith McNulty's article on Medium. I loved futbol/European soccer ever since high school, so I wanted to a visual on futbol history. Originally, I found some match statistics on Cristiano Ronaldo's career; however, the data was sparse (as I wanted a variety of colors and shifts in the plot across years). I was able to come across a database on Kaggle where I was able to leverage significantly large match and team data coming from the FIFA video game series through 2008-2016!
